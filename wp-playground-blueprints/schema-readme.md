The JSON schema stored in this directory describes how to validate
the Blueprints and is autogenerated from the Blueprints TypeScript types.

The Blueprint schema validator stored in this directory is used to validate
Blueprints and is autogenerated from the Blueprints JSON schema.

Whenever the types are modified, the schema and validator need to be
rebuilt using `nx build playground-blueprints` and then committed to
the repository.

Unfortunately, they are not auto-rebuilt in `npm run dev` mode as the
`dts-bundle-generator` utility we use for type rollyps does not support
watching for changes.
